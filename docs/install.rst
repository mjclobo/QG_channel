QG_channel installation
=========================================

How do I install the QG_channel model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I recommend cloning the QG_channel Github repository,
using Git.

Also, if you plan on making changes to the code, you should
fork the main QG_channel repository.
Whenever you'd like to contribute your changes to the official
version of QG_channel, just submit a pull request.


Do I need Github in order to install QG_channel?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No.
In order to install a .zip file of QG_channel, without
a Github account, just:

- Click on the green square labeled *Clone*
- Click *Download ZIP* at the bottom of the dropdown menu

However, there are many advantages to having a Github account, such as:

- Tracking changes you make to your version of the code
- Having a seamless pipeline for downloading updated versions of the code
- Being able to contribute improvements to the QG_channel source code
